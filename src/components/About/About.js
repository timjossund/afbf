                    About the AFBF
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The Arkansas Fundamental Baptist Fellowship consists of a group of independent Baptist pastors, evangelists, and other full-time preachers. The AFBF gathers together monthly for the purpose of advancing the work and ministry of the lord Jesus Christ through the local independent Baptist churches in Arkansas. The AFBF is a loosely organized group of Baptist preachers contributing into a monthly fund that is used to support new church planting in Arkansas.
                    We also endeavor, with love, to encourage and to challenge the pastors, church planters, and other preachers concerning the work of God. The Apostle Paul admonished young Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:5, “But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.” <br /><br />There are four things that we as servants of God must do if we intend to please the Lord as instructed by Paul. <br />
                    1. Become a Devoted Watchman as a servant of the cross
                    …but watch thou in all things
                    <br />
                    2. Become a Dedicated Warrior for Christ
                    …endue afflictions
                    <br />
                    3. Become a Dutiful Witness of the power of the cross
                    …do the work of an evangelist
                    <br />
                    4. Become one that Demonstrates some Worth in the ministry of the gospel
                    …make full proof of thy ministry
                    <br /><br />
                    The AFBF cannot take any credit, nor assign any blame as each pastor and preacher has been called by God, then assigned, accordingly, to the work of God. We are only privileged to work side by side with each other in the Lord’s vineyard. We look forward to each and any opportunity to gather together for the preaching of the word of God, and to help a young church planter in the work of the gospel.
                    <br /><br />
